Device for signaling the threat to life and health due to air pollution with volatile organic compounds



The objective of the project was to create a portable air quality meter with the option of measuring temperature and humidity. 
The device comes with a web application that allows you to monitor the condition of the indoor air. 
The application should signal when the standards of volatile organic compounds will be exceeded with a description of their impact on human health, as well as inform about the quality of the air outside. 
To assemble the device, were used: Arduino Uno, CCS811 sensor (measuring the concentration of volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide) and the dht11 sensor (measuring temperature and humidity). 
The system was programmed in the Arduino IDE. Then an application was created that connects to the Wifi network and displays the measurements from the sensors. 
The application is additionally to indicate remedies when the harmful substances reach too high levels and present the sources of their formation.
